# Preface
Hi! My name is Quentin Dariol. I am a confirmed research and development engineer in the field of embedded hardware architectures. I am currently working on embedded hardware architectures and associated compilers for the company [Keysom](https://keysom.io/), in the region of Bordeaux, France.

In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the growth of the field increasingly depends on our ability to deploy complex algorithms on embedded systems. Yet this is a demanding challenge: AI workloads typically require significant computational and memory resources, which are often limited in embedded environments. Further complicating matters, these systems must operate within strict timing constraints and tight power budgets—conditions that are not naturally suited to AI applications. Recognizing these challenges, I have dedicated my research and engineering efforts to optimizing the alignment between algorithms and hardware, with a particular focus on enabling efficient deployment of AI algorithms on embedded Systems-on-Chip (SoCs).

# Provided teachings
I had the pleasure to give the following teachings (practical sessions) at the Electronics and Digital Technologies Department of the Graduate School of Engineering of Nantes Université (Polytech'Nantes):
- **Hardware/Software (HW/SW) System Co-Design**
    - Master 2 level, taught in 2021-2022 and 2020-2021. This course teaches a specification, design and implementation methodology of embedded systems architectures, combining the Hardware and Software aspect. Various technologies are used in this course: system specification and design in the Intel Confluent Studio software, design and test of HW/SW applications on MPSoCs (FPGA) using Xilinx Vivado and Vitis (SDK).
- **Technical projects**,
    - Master 2 level, taught in 2021-2022 and 2020-2021. This involves the supervision of students working on a embedded systems engineering industrial or research project. Students dedicate one day per week to their technical project during one semester. Example of projects supervised: Development of Convolutional Neural Network applications on an embedded multi-core platform on FPGA.
- **Digital Circuits Design**,
    - Master 1 level, taught in 2021-2022. This course teaches a methodology of specification, design and verification of applications implemented on embedded systems. This course focuses on the example of a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) receiver circuit. Students use HDL Designer along with RTL simulation to describe and validate the design.
- **Real-Time Embedded Software**,
    - Master 1 level, taught in 2020-2021. In this course, students learn to develop embedded applications with real time constraints. They use the Real Time Operating System (RTOS) VxWorks in the tool Wind River Workbench.
